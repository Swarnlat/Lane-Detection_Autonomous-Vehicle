# Lane-Detection_Autonomous-Vehicle
This project focuses on building a Python-based autonomous vehicle system that can simulate real-time driving decisions using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The system is designed to detect road lanes, recognize objects (like pedestrians and vehicles), and simulate autonomous driving behavior based on visual input.
